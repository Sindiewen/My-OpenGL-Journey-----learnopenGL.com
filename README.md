# My-OpenGL-Learning-Journey-----learnopenGL.com
I'm Learning OpenGL from https://learnopengl.com! Using the ebook version of their tutorial series on their site, i'm logging each project and any other relevent projects from that chapter in their own folders.
I'll probably log my own notes in here too as a reference to how far i've learned.

I'm using Visual Studio 2017 and using C++.

There's 2 folders:
- LearnOpenGL_2018 
    - Before I ragequitted because of some silliness. I had issues loading a shader and trying to assign the source to a const string which i solved 6 months later or something then i got busy with school. My old journey. Depricated.
- LearnOpenGL_2020 
    - It's covid19 pandemic time, things are opening up, it's time to restart this and hope I can learn some of this before the floodgates of "it's time to go back on site for work and school". Can i live as a hermit pls? commuting hard :c

    I really hope I can push myself to learn this. Programming graphics looks so fun.
