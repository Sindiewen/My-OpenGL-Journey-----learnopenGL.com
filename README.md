# My-OpenGL-Learning-Journey-----learnopenGL.com
I'm Learning OpenGL from https://learnopengl.com! Using the ebook version of their tutorial series on their site, i'm logging each project and any other relevent projects from that chapter in their own folders.
I'll probably log my own notes in here too as a reference to how far i've learned.

I'm using Visual Studio 2017 and using C++.
